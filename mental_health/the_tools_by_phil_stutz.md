# The Tools by Phil Stutz

A tool is a bridge between what you realise the problem is (and the cause of the problem) to at least gaining some control
over the symptom. It all has to do with possibility: possibility means you feel yourself reacting differently.

## Life Force
There is something that will apply to anyone who doesn't have a sense of direction or 
of they don't know what they should do next. And the answer is you can always work on 
Life Force.

The only way to find out what you should be doing is to activate your life force. The Life Force
is the only part of you that actually is capable of guiding you when lost. 
You can think of it as a 3-level Pyramid. The bottom layer is your relationship with your physical body.
The second layer is your relationship with other people. And the highest level is your relationhip with your self.

BODY: All you got to do is getting your body working better: Exercise, diet, sleeping.

PEOPLE: When people get depressed, it is not that they end their relationship. It's more like they 
pull back from their life. Your relationships are like hand holds that allow you to get pull back into life.
The key is that you have to take the initiative. If you wait for them to take it then you don't understand.

YOURSELF: Get yourself in a relationship with your unconscious. One trick about this is **writing**. You enhance
your relationship with yourself by writing. Writing reflects what's going on in your unconcious and things will
come out of you. 

**If you are lost, don't try to figure it out - work on your Life Force first. Increasing your Life Force let you find out
what you are really passionate about.**


## Part X
Part X is the judgemental part of you. It is the anti-social part of you. It is an invisible force that want's to keep 
you from changing and growing. It want's to block your evolution. It want's to block your potential. Part X is the voice
of impossibility. It creates that primal fear in human beeings.

You can't get rid of Part X. You can defeat it temporarily but it will keep coming back. That's why you get **3 Aspects of Reality**
that nobody gets to avoid.

### 3 Aspects of Reality
PAIN, UNCERTAINTY & CONSTANT WORK

Those are the things you have to live with - no matter what! If you could get rid of it there will be no further progress.
We need Part X otherwise there is no change, no growth, no bravery.

**We need the negativity of Part X or else we don't grow. What will make you happy is the process. You have to learn how to love the 
process dealing with those 3 things. That's where the tools come in. When it appears you can identify it and then you can use a tool.**


## String of Pearls
This is probably the most important thing, motivatiionally, that you can teach yourself. You just draw a string of pearls. There is 
a line followed by a circle, then a line, then a circle, etc.. Each one of those circles equals one action. Every action has the same
value. This is a matter of identity. Who am I? I look at myself just in terms of the habbits with which I take actions. If there is a failure
or a big success - either way you keep going. **I am the person who puts the next pearl on the string.**

In every one of these circles, there is a little darker circle (much smaller). The darker circle is dirt. It says whatever you do it's not going
to be perfect. There is some dirt in it. I don't have to care about it, I just need to move forward. 

## The Shadow
Everybody shadows. Everybody's shadow is the same becaue it is the part of themselves they are ashamed of. The first thing you have to do is to 
find your shadow, so you can focus on it and work on it:

Close your eyes. Now, visualize the time in your life when you felt inferiour, emberrased, rejected that you are ashamed of it. It is the 
part of you that you wish you were not - but your are. The question is, what do you do with that image in the present? Talk to your shadow 
and ask them how does they feel about you. How you dealt with them, how you treated them and see what they answer. 

**The Shadow needs attention. And it needs it only from you, so ask your shadow what you can do to make the shadow feel better.**

## The Snapshot (aka the realm of illusion)
It means that you are looking for a perfect experience. It could be the perfect wife, the perfect amount of money in the bank, etc.. It
doesn't really matter. It is just an image in your own mind and doesn't really exist. It is created by Part X, so you should never forget about the 
3 aspects of Reality. Everybody has to live like that - no matter what.

## The Maze
The Maze always involves other people. It's the product of part X because part X wants fairness. If you feel mistreated and request for fairness. 
This will put your life on hold.  

The way you feel things are beeing rebalanced is through an exercise, called **Active Love**

### Active Love
Close your eyes and imagine that you are sourrounded by universe completely made out of love. You take in all that love and place it in your heart.
Now you are the leader of love in the universe. Now you want to see that person you are angry at and you send all that love you've concentrated towards
the other person. You hold nothing back - you give everything. You really feel the love entering this person and you become one with this person.


## Radical Acceptance
Every event has something in it that you can learn from. You really have to squeeze the juice and find  something meaningful in it.
You need to look at all events as having value. If you can do that then you are in the zone of tremendous opportunity. 

## The Grateful Flow
Part X wants you to have the negative flow, so it will create the black cloud above you and you forget that it is sunny up there.
So you cant see the sun. The question is, how can you penetrate the cloud? The answer is **with gratefulness**.

The grateful flow is not the things you are grateful for. It is the process of creating these things:

Close your eyes. Say two or three of the most four things you are grateful for. The smaller the thing the better because it forces
you to concentrate gratefulness. Do it nice and slow, you want to feel the gratefulness. Then keep naming things but don't say them
out loud - just keep crating that stream of gratefulnes. The next thing you do is you feel that you are going to create another grateful
thought but you don't - you block it! So all you feel is a force that **would** create a grateful thought and as it gets stronger and stronger
you feel taken over by it. 

The key is not saying the same things over and over again. You want to make it a creative act. When you have to dig and work on it to find
these things. That process itself  will change your mood. 

The time to use it is when your thoughts are out of control. The worst thing you can do is arguing with them. The affect is terrible for you. 

## Loss Processing
Most people are very bad at it. Not only bad when there is a loss but also before the loss - they just worry about it. 
The goal is to get what's called **the potency of non-attachement**. That means I can pursue something but I'm willing
not to have it. I still want to pursue it really hard but I'm also willing to lose. 

Pick something that you feel you've become too attached to. It could be a person a job, it doesn't really matter. 
It has to be something you are afraid, if you let it go, something bad happens. 
Now imagine you're grasping this thing. Like your grasping a branch on a tree. It's scary - your're afraid to let go. 
But you let go anyway.And when you let go, you start to fall. It's not a bad sensation though. The falling is slow and gentle,
to your surprise. You are falling and you say **I'm willing to lose everything**. You have to say it silently but you really
need to feel the intent behind it. The moment you say that you hit the surface of the sun and your body burns up. 
Now at that point you have lost everything because the instrument of posession is your physical body. You are radiating out
int all directions. And what you're radiating is a very loving, giving outflowing sensation. And then you look around and you see
around you is an infinite number of other suns - all which are radiating outwards. And then you hear the suns saying in unison
**WE ARE EVERYWHERE**. This world is calling the sun world - all you can do is **give**, you can't take. You can't grasp. 
You can't hold on anything. It's just impossible. 

**The goal is not becoming completely nonattached but working towards non-attachement!**
