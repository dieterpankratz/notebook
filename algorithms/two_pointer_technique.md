# The two-pointer-technique
Used for searching with two pointers in one loop over the given data structure (string, array, linked list).

## Benefits
If the data structure is sorted the two pointer technique helps to reduce the time complexity from O(n^2) to O(n). 

## Variants
* Opposite directional: One pointer starts from the beginning while the other pointer starts from the end. They move toward each other until they both meet
  or some condition satisfy.
  
* Equi-directional: Both start from the beginning, one slow-runner and the other fast-runner.

## Leetcode 
### Opposite directional:
* 167
* 125
* 283
* 344
* 27

### Equi-directional:
* 141 
* 3
* 26
