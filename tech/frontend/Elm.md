# Elm

Elm is a programming language that compiles to JavaScript. One of the advanteges about Elm is its bundle size.
Since SPAs become more and more common as the way we are deploying our frontends bundle size is getting also more 
and more important. Compared to the popular frameworks like React, Vue and Angular the bundle size of Elm is much
smaller. You often read that Elm is the never crashing because the compiler catches all exceptions at compile time 
so there are no runtime exceptions ðŸª„
